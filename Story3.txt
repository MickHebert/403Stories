He bet it all on a horse named 'Last Chance', an overweight stallion with a 6'4 jockey. After the slot machine from Hell drained all of his funds, he decided to place his last $20 bill on the +400000 odds horse with no chance.

A strategy he likes to call "excitement investing", as he is not "addicted" to "gambling".

His only motivation is a big win, but he has yet to hit it big.

He is in crippling debt...
